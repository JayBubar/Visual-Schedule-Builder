# Activity Library â†” Schedule Builder Integration Test

## âœ… Implementation Status

### 1. Event Listeners (COMPLETED)
- âœ… `activityAdded` event listener in ScheduleBuilder.tsx
- âœ… `activitiesUpdated` event listener in ScheduleBuilder.tsx
- âœ… Event cleanup on component unmount
- âœ… Debug logging for event handling

### 2. Event Dispatching (COMPLETED)
- âœ… Activity Library dispatches `activityAdded` on "+ Add" button click
- âœ… Activity Library dispatches `activitiesUpdated` when activities are modified
- âœ… Events include proper activity data in detail object

### 3. localStorage Integration (COMPLETED)
- âœ… `custom_activities` key for Activity Library custom activities
- âœ… `available_activities` key for Schedule Builder sidebar activities
- âœ… Automatic sync between Activity Library and Schedule Builder
- âœ… Persistence across browser sessions

### 4. Enhanced Group Assignment System (COMPLETED)
- âœ… **ðŸ‘¥ Whole Class**: Everyone together
- âœ… **ðŸ‘¤ Small Groups**: Divided groups  
- âœ… **ðŸ§‘ Individual**: Each student alone
- âœ… **ðŸ”„ Flexible**: Mixed arrangements
- âœ… Visual feedback for selected grouping type
- âœ… Proper state management between modes

### 5. UI Integration (COMPLETED)
- âœ… Activities appear in Schedule Builder sidebar when added from Library
- âœ… Custom activities show "Custom" badge
- âœ… Support for emoji and image icons
- âœ… Integration status indicator
- âœ… Responsive grouping type selector

## ðŸ”„ Data Flow

```
Activity Library
    â†“ (+ Add button clicked)
